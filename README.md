# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Test Increment / Decrement React Component

This is a small test component which could be the basis for a shopping cart or other functions.

It currently does not have any external calls, and is only storing temporary values locally.

onMounted with AJAX calls could be added for remote DB functionality.

This mini-project was used to test deployability to [GH pages.](https://dev-kris.github.io/react_app/).

## Technologies Used

React
Bootstrap v5.0.1

## To run locally
